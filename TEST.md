## WAVE

- I used the Chrome WAVE extension site-wide to thoroughly test and evaluate various accessibility aspects of my website. The tool was particularly helpful in identifying key areas related to structure, color contrast, and semantic organization. WAVE provided valuable insights into how well my site adhered to accessibility standards, highlighting elements that required adjustments, such as improving contrast ratios for better readability and ensuring a clear and logical structure for assistive technologies. This comprehensive analysis allowed me to make informed decisions to enhance the user experience and accessibility of my site.

## Validator Testing

### HTML

[W3C HTML Validator link](https://validator.w3.org/)

![HTML Validator](documents/images/testing/html_validator.png)

- All HTML files were manually validated using the W3C validator to check for errors. The results were interpreted with some flexibility, as the integration of other languages like Python triggered warnings and errors that were not directly related to the HTML structure.

### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator link](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input+with_options)

![CSS Validator](documents/images/testing/css_validator.png)

- All project app static CSS files were manually entered and tested. Each file passed successfully, with only a few warnings identified. These warnings were primarily due to the use of frameworks like Bootstrap.

### JavaScript

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

![JS Hint](documents/images/testing/js_hint.png)

- JS Hint was used not only to test all JavaScript files, but also throughout the project to troubleshoot and resolve issues in my JavaScript code.

### PEP8

[PEP8](http://ww7.pep8online.com/)

- This validation tested python code, in the app.py and was used throughout the development giving key indications of what was not compliant and the reason for this. This helped keep the code clean and readable throughout the development.

### Flake8 

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

- Flake8 was utilised to validate the Python codebase, revealing several issues such as inconsistent indentation, trailing whitespace, missing blank lines, and lines exceeding the maximum length limit. Most of these issues, including indentation, whitespace, and blank line errors, were resolved. However, the excessively long lines in migration files, as well as a few other instances of long lines, were deferred for future resolution to avoid disrupting critical code functionality.

## Ligthouse

[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)

Lighthouse, a powerful Chrome DevTools feature, provided invaluable insights into the functionality, layout, and overall readability of my site. It allowed me to evaluate key aspects such as performance, accessibility, and best practices, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. By analyzing the siteâ€™s structure and styles, Lighthouse highlighted areas where the layout could be optimized for various screen sizes, helping to create a responsive design that looks great on all devices.

### Desktop Results

## Issues/ Bugs Found, Resolved & Unresolved

Throughout the development of the site, numerous issues and bugs needed to be resolved to bring it to its current state. Below are some of the key bugs and challenges that took the most time to fix:

1. __Signup Error After Deployment:__
  - After deploying to Heroku, there was a "Server 500 error" when a new user attempted to sign up. This was resolved by adding a runtime.txt file at the root level of the project.

2. __Missing Images:__
  - Most images displayed correctly after deployment, but four images did not. After hours of troubleshooting, the solution was simple: adding {{ MEDIA_URL }} in the relevant HTML files to correctly reference the images stored on AWS.

3. __Adding Tour Information Summary:__
  - This issue was resolved by correcting the context.py file, adjusting the for loop in checkout.html, and modifying view.py to retrieve the current travel_backpack object.

4. __Stripe Working Locally, Not on Deployed Site:__
  - Troubleshooting this issue took a lot of time, but the solution was straightforward: the deployed webhook URL was missing a trailing '/' after "wh" in the URL.

5. __Site-Wide Horizontal Scrolling:__
  - Horizontal scrolling was an intermittent issue throughout the project. Initially, it was fixed by setting overflow: hidden on the body, but when sticky elements were needed on the tour breakdown page, the solution was refined by applying 'overflow-x: hidden !important;' to the footer, overriding Bootstrap's classes.

### Unresolved

- One unresolved issue is the loading overlay during the payment process. The overlay text is positioned in the top-left corner, rather than being centrally aligned both vertically and horizontally as intended. Despite many hours of adjustments, as reflected in the commits, and attempts using Bootstrap structuring, classes and custom CSS, achieving the desired alignment causes the overlay to appear prematurely at the start of checkout.
