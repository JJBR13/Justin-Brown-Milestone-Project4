## Ligthouse

[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)

Lighthouse, a powerful Chrome DevTools feature, provided invaluable insights into the functionality, layout, and overall readability of my site. It allowed me to evaluate key aspects such as performance, accessibility, and best practices, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. By analyzing the siteâ€™s structure and styles, Lighthouse highlighted areas where the layout could be optimized for various screen sizes, helping to create a responsive design that looks great on all devices.
