## WAVE

- I used the Chrome WAVE extension site-wide to thoroughly test and evaluate various accessibility aspects of my website. The tool was particularly helpful in identifying key areas related to structure, color contrast, and semantic organization. WAVE provided valuable insights into how well my site adhered to accessibility standards, highlighting elements that required adjustments, such as improving contrast ratios for better readability and ensuring a clear and logical structure for assistive technologies. This comprehensive analysis allowed me to make informed decisions to enhance the user experience and accessibility of my site.

## Validator Testing

### HTML

[W3C HTML Validator link](https://validator.w3.org/)

![HTML Validator](documents/images/testing/html_validator.png)

- All HTML files were manually validated using the W3C validator to check for errors. The results were interpreted with some flexibility, as the integration of other languages like Python triggered warnings and errors that were not directly related to the HTML structure.

### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator link](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input+with_options)

![CSS Validator](documents/images/testing/css_validator.png)

- All project app static CSS files were manually entered and tested. Each file passed successfully, with only a few warnings identified. These warnings were primarily due to the use of frameworks like Bootstrap.

### JavaScript

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

![JS Hint](documents/images/testing/js_hint.png)

- JS Hint was used not only to test all JavaScript files, but also throughout the project to troubleshoot and resolve issues in my JavaScript code.

### PEP8

[PEP8](http://ww7.pep8online.com/)

- This validation tested python code, in the app.py and was used throughout the development giving key indications of what was not compliant and the reason for this. This helped keep the code clean and readable throughout the development.

### Flake8 

- Flake8 was utilised to validate the Python codebase, revealing several issues such as inconsistent indentation, trailing whitespace, missing blank lines, and lines exceeding the maximum length limit. Most of these issues, including indentation, whitespace, and blank line errors, were resolved. However, the excessively long lines in migration files, as well as a few other instances of long lines, were deferred for future resolution to avoid disrupting critical code functionality.

## Ligthouse

[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)

Lighthouse, a powerful Chrome DevTools feature, provided invaluable insights into the functionality, layout, and overall readability of my site. It allowed me to evaluate key aspects such as performance, accessibility, and best practices, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. By analyzing the siteâ€™s structure and styles, Lighthouse highlighted areas where the layout could be optimized for various screen sizes, helping to create a responsive design that looks great on all devices.

### Desktop Results
